# Recurring Finance üí∞

A decentralized application (dApp) for automating cryptocurrency payments using smart wallet delegation and session keys. Built on Ethereum-compatible networks, this platform enables users to set up recurring payments with custom schedules, beneficiaries, and spending limits.

## üåü Features

### Core Functionality
- **Smart Wallet Integration**: Generate and manage smart EOA (Externally Owned Account) wallets
- **Session Key Management**: Delegate spending authority to relayers with daily limits and expiration dates
- **Recurring Payments**: Set up automated payments with complex cron-like schedules
- **Multi-Beneficiary Support**: Send payments to multiple recipients in a single transaction
- **Token Flexibility**: Support for any ERC-20 token (USDC, ETH, etc.)

### Advanced Scheduling
- **Flexible Timing**: Set start and end dates for payment schedules
- **Cron-like Scheduling**: Configure payments to run on specific:
  - Hours (24-hour format)
  - Days of the week
  - Days of the month
  - Months of the year
- **Real-time Preview**: Visual feedback showing your configured schedule

### Security & Control
- **Spending Limits**: Set daily spending limits for delegated accounts
- **Time-bound Delegation**: Session keys automatically expire
- **Smart Contract Security**: Built on audited smart contract patterns
- **Relayer Architecture**: Secure execution through trusted relayers

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Smart Contracts
- **DistributorFactory**: Creates and manages distributor contracts
- **Distributor**: Handles recurring payment logic and execution
- **Session Key System**: Manages delegation and spending limits

### Frontend Stack

    ```
    For local development, you can use the following private key:
    ```env
    NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVATE_KEY=0x22ea21180cde9a963a303deb128a1d04bcf8e4735492d53c1dfd040522c18b04
    ```


4. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

5. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the application.


## üí° Usage

### Setting Up Recurring Payments

1. **Connect Your Wallet**
